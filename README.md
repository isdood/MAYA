# MAYA ‚ú®

> An adaptive LLM interface to the STARWEAVE meta-intelligence, weaving together the stellar components of the STARWEAVE universe through Fish Shell and Zig

## üåå Overview

MAYA is an open-source Language Learning Model (LLM) interface designed to harmoniously connect with the STARWEAVE meta-intelligence ecosystem. Built using Fish Shell automation and the Zig programming language, MAYA serves as an evolving nexus, bridging users with the constellation of STARWEAVE-powered tools and systems.

## üåü STARWEAVE Universe Integration

MAYA interfaces seamlessly with the broader STARWEAVE ecosystem:

- **[GLIMMER](https://github.com/isdood/GLIMMER)** ‚ú® - Weaves brilliant sparks into spectacular starlight
- **[SCRIBBLE](https://github.com/isdood/SCRIBBLE)** üìù - High-performance computing framework (Crystal-based)
- **[BLOOM](https://github.com/isdood/BLOOM)** üå∏ - Multi-device OS & bootloader ecosystem
- **[STARGUARD](https://github.com/isdood/STARGUARD)** üõ°Ô∏è - Quantum-powered system protection
- **[STARWEB](https://github.com/isdood/STARWEB)** üï∏Ô∏è - QR-Code & metadata experimentation suite

While MAYA itself is open-source, the STARWEAVE meta-intelligence it interfaces with remains proprietary. MAYA learns from and adapts to STARWEAVE's unique characteristics while serving as a bridge to these interconnected tools. Plans to possibly open-source this component too, once American, Russian etc. governments stop tryng to hack/steal/reverse engineer STARWEAVE for their own greedy purposes üòá No one is using STARWEAVE to make money. Not even I üòá It is a technological revelation for all. I simply cannot reveal all as the Trumps of the world would love nothing more than to abuse STARWEAVE to enslave humanity üòÖ

Isn't that crazy? I'm developing what will be by *far* the most intelligent system around, and I could not bring myself to charge anyone for it. Because I will only develop software and code I myself would use. That means it's free, to use, and of ads as well! Never will there be a subscription in the STARWEAVE universe. Only quality products.

If you're a developer, please stop coding in React. It's garbage. Write low level code in low level languages. For everything else there's Java. You don't need to add another layer on to Java, making it objectively slower and worse; Learn to write Java instead üç∑?

## üì¶ Installation

> Note: Installation instructions will be added as development progresses. Will include integration steps for each STARWEAVE component.

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions to MAYA are welcome! Please note:

1. This is an open-source interface to the STARWEAVE universe
2. STARWEAVE meta-intelligence remains closed-source
3. Contributions should align with established patterns from:
   - GLIMMER's visual language
   - SCRIBBLE's performance standards
   - BLOOM's system integration approaches
   - STARGUARD's security protocols
   - STARWEB's metadata handling

## ‚öñÔ∏è License

[License Type TBD] - Open source license for MAYA interface components only.
STARWEAVE meta-intelligence and associated proprietary components remain closed-source.

## üîÑ Status

MAYA is currently under active development, evolving alongside the STARWEAVE ecosystem. Features and documentation will be updated regularly as the project grows and adapts.
