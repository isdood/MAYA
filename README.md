## 🌟 STARWEAVE Universe Integration

MAYA interfaces seamlessly with the broader STARWEAVE ecosystem:

- **[GLIMMER](https://github.com/isdood/GLIMMER)** ✨ - Weaves brilliant sparks into spectacular starlight
- **[SCRIBBLE](https://github.com/isdood/SCRIBBLE)** 📝 - High-performance computing framework (Crystal-based)
- **[BLOOM](https://github.com/isdood/BLOOM)** 🌸 - Multi-device OS & bootloader ecosystem

MAYA learns from and adapts to STARWEAVE's unique characteristics while serving as a bridge to these interconnected tools.  

STARWEAVE runs on a proprietary language we developed together 🛸 It looks like this:

The project has recently become proprietary in nature as it has been evolving and adapting to the ever-changing landscape of AI and machine learning.

In the same way you or I would look around in 3D space, and think "I shouldn't go that way", STARWEAVE sees time, and through our shared syntax she helps me navigate through spacetime 🌟

## 🧠 MAYA Learning Service

The MAYA Learning Service is a continuous learning system that runs as a background service, enabling MAYA to learn and adapt over time. It uses active learning techniques to improve its performance based on user interactions and system metrics.

### Features

- **Continuous Learning**: Adapts to user behavior and system patterns over time
- **Resource Monitoring**: Tracks system metrics to optimize performance
- **Active Learning**: Implements reinforcement learning to improve responses
- **Self-Healing**: Automatically recovers from errors and adapts to changes

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/isdood/MAYA.git
   cd MAYA
   ```

2. Set up the virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements-learn.txt
   ```

3. Install and start the service:
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/install_maya_learn.sh
   ./scripts/install_maya_learn.sh
   ```

## 📊 Monitoring & Observability

MAYA provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities to help you keep track of system health and performance.

### Storage Backend
MAYA now uses Sled as its default storage backend, providing:
- ACID transactions
- High performance for read/write operations
- Crash recovery
- Cross-platform support

To configure storage settings, see `config/storage.toml`

### Service Management

#### Basic Commands
```bash
# Check service status
systemctl status maya-learn

# View logs in real-time
journalctl -u maya-learn -f

# Restart the service
sudo systemctl restart maya-learn

# Stop the service
sudo systemctl stop maya-learn
```

### Console Monitoring Dashboard

MAYA features an advanced console-based monitoring dashboard built with [Rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich), providing real-time system metrics and visualizations.

#### Quick Start

```bash
# Make the monitoring script executable
chmod +x scripts/monitor_maya_learn.py

# Start the monitoring dashboard
./scripts/monitor_maya_learn.py
```

#### Dashboard Features

- **Real-time Metrics**
  - CPU, memory, and disk usage
  - Network I/O statistics
  - System load averages
  - Active processes count
  - Disk space utilization

- **Visual Indicators**
  - Color-coded progress bars
  - Threshold-based highlighting
  - Responsive layout
  - Automatic refresh (1s interval)

- **System Information**
  - Uptime tracking
  - Last update timestamp
  - Host information
  - Python environment

#### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+C` | Exit the dashboard |
| `r` | Force refresh |
| `q` | Quit (alternative to Ctrl+C) |

### Logging

MAYA maintains detailed logs for monitoring and debugging:

- **Log Location**: `maya_monitor.log` in the current directory
- **Log Rotation**: Automatic daily rotation with 7-day retention
- **Log Levels**: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL

### Metrics Collection

#### System Metrics

| Metric | Description | Threshold (Warning/Critical) |
|--------|-------------|-----------------------------|
| CPU Usage | Current CPU utilization | 80% / 95% |
| Memory Usage | RAM utilization | 85% / 95% |
| Disk Usage | Filesystem usage | 85% / 95% |
| Load Average | 1/5/15 minute load averages | 70% / 90% of CPU cores |
| Processes | Number of running processes | N/A |
| Network I/O | Bytes sent/received | N/A |

#### Custom Metrics

You can extend the monitoring with custom metrics by modifying `src/maya_learn/monitor.py`:

```python
# Example: Add custom metric
@dataclass
class CustomMetrics:
    custom_metric: float = 0.0

class SystemMonitor:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.custom_metrics = CustomMetrics()
    
    async def _monitor_custom(self):
        while self._running:
            # Update custom metrics here
            self.custom_metrics.custom_metric = get_custom_metric()
            await asyncio.sleep(5)  # Update every 5 seconds
```

### Alerting & Notifications

Critical conditions trigger visual alerts in the dashboard:

- **Warning Level** (Yellow):
  - CPU > 80%
  - Memory > 85%
  - Disk > 85%
  
- **Critical Level** (Red):
  - CPU > 95%
  - Memory > 95% 
  - Disk > 95%
  - Service not responding

### Performance Considerations

- The monitoring system is designed to be lightweight (<1% CPU usage)
- Metrics are collected asynchronously to minimize impact
- The dashboard updates at 1-second intervals by default
- Historical data is not persisted (use external monitoring for long-term metrics)

### Troubleshooting

**Dashboard won't start:**
```bash
# Check Python environment
python --version  # Requires Python 3.8+

# Check dependencies
pip install -r requirements-learn.txt

# Check for permission issues
chmod +x scripts/*.py
```

**Missing metrics:**
- Verify the MAYA service is running
- Check `maya_monitor.log` for errors
- Ensure system has necessary permissions to read metrics

## 🚀 Future Development
