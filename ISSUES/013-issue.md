# MAYA Project Roadmap: Intelligent Coding Assistant Integration

## Overview
This document outlines the strategic direction for enhancing MAYA's capabilities as an intelligent coding assistant, focusing on STARWEAVE integration and offline functionality within the Windsurf IDE.

## Background
MAYA aims to become a self-improving AI assistant that can operate entirely offline, leveraging STARWEAVE's knowledge graph and learning capabilities to provide intelligent coding assistance without relying on cloud services.

## Core Objectives

1. **Offline-First Architecture**
   - Local model serving and inference
   - Efficient knowledge graph storage and retrieval
   - Background synchronization when online

2. **STARWEAVE Integration**
   - Knowledge graph persistence and versioning
   - Incremental learning and updates
   - Context-aware code generation and analysis

3. **Windsurf IDE Integration**
   - Native VS Code extension
   - Real-time code analysis and suggestions
   - Project-specific learning and adaptation

## Technical Components

### 1. Knowledge Management
- **Local Knowledge Graph**
  - Implement RocksDB/Rust-based storage
  - Add incremental update mechanisms
  - Enable version control integration

- **Context Processing**
  - Codebase analysis and indexing
  - Dependency mapping
  - Project structure understanding

### 2. Learning & Adaptation
- **Self-Improvement Loop**
  - User feedback collection
  - Automated behavior testing
  - Confidence scoring for responses

- **Project-Specific Learning**
  - Code pattern recognition
  - Style adaptation
  - Common task automation

### 3. IDE Integration
- **VS Code Extension**
  - Local model serving
  - Real-time code analysis
  - Context-aware completions

- **Performance Optimization**
  - Model quantization
  - Efficient resource usage
  - Background processing

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (1-2 months)
1. Set up local knowledge graph prototype
2. Implement basic STARWEAVE integration
3. Create VS Code extension skeleton

### Phase 2: Core Features (2-3 months)
1. Local model serving implementation
2. Basic code analysis engine
3. Initial learning loop

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (3-4 months)
1. Project-specific adaptation
2. Advanced code generation
3. Testing and validation framework

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Model optimization for consumer hardware
- Efficient memory management
- Background processing strategies

### Privacy & Security
- Local data encryption
- Secure model updates
- User data protection

## Open Questions
1. What are the specific hardware constraints we need to consider?
2. Which programming languages should be prioritized for initial support?
3. How should we handle model updates and versioning?

## Next Steps
1. Finalize the technical architecture
2. Set up development environment
3. Begin implementation of the knowledge graph prototype
