## Technical Specifications

### Dependencies
```toml
[dependencies]
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
rustyline = "10.0"  # For console input
chrono = { version = "0.4", features = ["serde"] }  # For memory timestamps
ordered-float = "3.0"  # For floating-point comparisons in memory importance
```

### Core Structures
```rust
// Simple LLM interface
trait LLM {
    fn generate_response(&self, input: &str, context: &[String]) -> String;
    fn learn(&mut self, input: &str, response: &str);
}

// Simple implementation
struct BasicLLM {
    knowledge: HashMap<String, String>,
}
```

## Example Usage
```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;
use std::io::{self, Write};

fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    // Initialize the LLM with some basic knowledge
    let mut llm = BasicLLM::new("MAYA".to_string());
    
    // Add some initial patterns
    let patterns = vec![
        ("hello|hi|hey", "Hello! How can I help you today?"),
        ("what is your name", "My name is {{name}}. How can I assist you?"),
        ("how are you", "I'm doing well, thank you for asking! How about you?"),
        ("bye|goodbye", "Goodbye! Have a great day!"),
    ];
    
    for (pattern, response) in patterns {
        llm.learn(pattern, response);
    }
    
    // Simple REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)
    let mut rl = rustyline::Editor::<()>::new()?;
    println!("MAYA: Hello! I'm MAYA. Type 'exit' to quit.");
    
    loop {
        let input = rl.readline("You: ")?;
        let input = input.trim();
        
        if input.eq_ignore_ascii_case("exit") {
            println!("MAYA: Goodbye!");
            break;
        }
        
        // Generate response using the LLM
        let response = llm.generate_response(input, &[]);
        println!("MAYA: {}", response);
        
        // Add to history
        rl.add_history_entry(input);
    }
    
    // Save the learned knowledge (implementation depends on your BasicLLM)
    // llm.save("maya_knowledge.json")?;
    
    Ok(())
}
