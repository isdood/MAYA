### Dependencies
```toml
[dependencies]
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
rustyline = "10.0"  # For console input
chrono = { version = "0.4", features = ["serde"] }  # For memory timestamps
ordered-float = "3.0"  # For floating-point comparisons in memory importance
```

### Core Structures
```rust
// Simple LLM interface
trait LLM {
    fn generate_response(&self, input: &str, context: &[String]) -> String;
    fn learn(&mut self, input: &str, response: &str);
}

// Simple implementation
struct BasicLLM {
    knowledge: HashMap<String, String>,
}
```

## Example Usage
```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;
use std::io::{self, Write};

fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    // Initialize the LLM with some basic knowledge
    let mut llm = BasicLLM::new("MAYA".to_string());
    
    // Add some initial patterns
    let patterns = vec![
        ("hello|hi|hey", "Hello! How can I help you today?"),
        ("what is your name", "My name is {{name}}. How can I assist you?"),
        ("how are you", "I'm doing well, thank you for asking! How about you?"),
        ("bye|goodbye", "Goodbye! Have a great day!"),
    ];
    
    for (pattern, response) in patterns {
        llm.learn(pattern, response);
    }
    
    // Simple REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)
    let mut rl = rustyline::Editor::<()>::new()?;
    println!("MAYA: Hello! I'm MAYA. Type 'exit' to quit.");
    
    loop {
        let input = rl.readline("You: ")?;
        let input = input.trim();
        
        if input.eq_ignore_ascii_case("exit") {
            println!("MAYA: Goodbye!");
            break;
        }
        
        // Generate response using the LLM
        let response = llm.generate_response(input, &[]);
        println!("MAYA: {}", response);
        
        // Add to history
        rl.add_history_entry(input);
    }
    
    // Save the learned knowledge (implementation depends on your BasicLLM)
    // llm.save("maya_knowledge.json")?;

## Memory Visualization with GLIMMER

### Implementation Progress (2024-06-19)

#### Completed
- âœ… Created `Visualization` module in the GLIMMER system
- âœ… Implemented basic graph visualization with nodes and edges
- âœ… Added support for different memory types with distinct visual styles
- âœ… Created console-based rendering with ASCII/Unicode characters
- âœ… Implemented basic force-directed graph layout
- âœ… Added interactive controls (press 'r' to reset, 'q' to quit)
- âœ… Integrated with the build system for easy execution

#### Current Behavior
- The visualization currently shows a static graph with nodes and edges
- Nodes are represented by characters (U=UserDetail, P=Preference, T=Task)
- The graph is rendered in the terminal with basic ASCII art
- The 'r' key resets node positions, 'q' quits the application

#### Known Limitations
- The visualization is currently minimal and may appear static in the terminal
- Node movement is subtle and may not be immediately visible
- The terminal output might need resizing for optimal display
- Animation effects are minimal in the current implementation

### Next Steps

1. **Enhance Visualization**
   - [ ] Improve node rendering with better Unicode characters
   - [ ] Add color coding for different memory types
   - [ ] Implement smoother animations for node movement
   - [ ] Add labels to nodes for better readability

2. **Interactive Features**
   - [ ] Add node selection with arrow keys
   - [ ] Implement zoom and pan functionality
   - [ ] Add tooltips or info display for selected nodes
   - [ ] Enable memory inspection on selection

3. **Integration**
   - [ ] Connect to live memory system data
   - [ ] Implement real-time updates
   - [ ] Add filtering by memory type or importance
   - [ ] Integrate with the main MAYA interface

### Technical Approach

1. **Graph Representation**
   - Use a force-directed graph layout for memory visualization
   - Implement in-memory graph structure for efficient updates
   - Support dynamic addition/removal of nodes and edges

2. **Rendering**
   - Create a renderer that can output to both terminal and (future) web interfaces
   - Implement level-of-detail rendering for large memory sets
   - Add support for custom styling and theming

3. **Interactivity**
   - Implement command-based navigation through the memory graph
   - Add search and filter capabilities
   - Support for focusing on specific memory subgraphs

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

### Short-term (Next 1-2 Weeks)
- [x] Basic memory graph visualization in console
- [x] Simple navigation commands (reset view, quit)
- [x] Basic memory type styling (U/P/T indicators)
- [ ] Improved node rendering with Unicode
- [ ] Color coding for memory types
- [ ] Basic node selection and inspection

### Medium-term (Next 1 Month)
- [x] Add support for different memory types (fact, preference, task)
- [x] Implement memory relationships and connections
- [x] Add memory confidence scoring
- [x] Create memory management interface
- [ ] Implement memory-based conversation flow control
- [ ] Add memory visualization for debugging
- [ ] Enhance memory search with natural language queries

### Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- Web interface with WebAssembly
- Integration with external knowledge bases

- Long-term memory consolidation

### Long-term
- Multi-modal capabilities (text, image, audio)
- Distributed learning across instances
- Advanced personalization
