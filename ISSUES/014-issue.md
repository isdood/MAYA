# Sled Storage Backend Migration - Progress and Next Steps

## Current Status

### Completed Work
- [x] Migrated from RocksDB to sled as the storage backend for the knowledge graph
- [x] Implemented sled-specific storage layer with proper serialization/deserialization
- [x] Fixed transaction handling and batch operations in the sled backend
- [x] Updated query system to properly filter and return edges
- [x] Fixed integration tests to work with the new storage backend
- [x] Added proper cleanup of temporary directories in tests
- [x] Improved test reliability and error messages

### Key Changes
- Replaced RocksDB-specific code with sled equivalents
- Implemented proper error handling for sled operations
- Added transaction support using sled's batch operations
- Updated the query system to work with the new storage backend
- Fixed edge cases in node and edge storage/retrieval

## Next Steps

### High Priority
1. **Clean up compiler warnings**
   - Fix unused imports and dead code warnings
   - Remove redundant clone operations
   - Implement Clone for SledWriteBatch if needed

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Profile the sled implementation for potential bottlenecks
   - Consider adding indexes for frequently queried properties
   - Optimize batch operations for better throughput

3. **Documentation**
   - Update README with new storage backend requirements
   - Document any breaking changes from the RocksDB implementation
   - Add examples for common operations with the new backend

### Medium Priority
4. **Testing**
   - Add more comprehensive test coverage for edge cases
   - Add benchmark tests to compare performance with previous implementation
   - Test with larger datasets to identify scalability issues

5. **Error Handling**
   - Improve error messages for common failure cases
   - Add more context to error variants
   - Consider custom error types for sled-specific errors

## Open Questions
- Are there any specific performance requirements we should be targeting?
- Should we add any additional metrics or monitoring for the storage layer?
- Are there any specific features from RocksDB that we're missing in sled?

## Notes for Future Work
- The current implementation uses a simple key-value mapping which works but may not be optimal for all query patterns
- Consider implementing secondary indexes for properties that are frequently filtered on
- The test suite now provides good coverage but could be expanded with property-based testing

## Environment
- sled version: 0.34.7
- Rust version: (check with `rustc --version`)
- OS: Linux
