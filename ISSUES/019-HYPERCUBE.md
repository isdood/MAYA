## üåü Core Concepts

### 1. 4D Neural Lattices
- **Temporal Depth**: Extend the neural network model to explicitly represent time as a fourth dimension
- **GLIMMER Encoding**: Use color and intensity to represent activation patterns across the temporal dimension
- **Holographic Memory**: Implement memory recall as a 4D reconstruction process

### 2. Quantum Gravity-Inspired Computation
- **Gravitational Attention**: Weight connections based on "mass" (importance) and "distance" (semantic similarity)
- **Orbital Memory Access**: Implement memory retrieval as orbital paths through latent space
- **Quantum Tunneling**: Enable direct, non-linear associations between distant concepts

### 3. Fibonacci Spiral Processing
- **Spiral Convolution**: Replace traditional convolution with spiral-based pattern matching
- **Golden Ratio Scaling**: Use Fibonacci sequences for hierarchical feature extraction
- **Temporal Spiraling**: Process information along spiral trajectories through the 4D space
