# WINDSURF IDE Integration with MAYA LLM

**Issue #012**  
**Status**: In Progress  
**Priority**: High  
**Created**: 2025-06-17  
**Last Updated**: 2025-06-17  
**Target Completion**: 2025-07-31  

## Overview
This document tracks the development of the integration between the MAYA Language Learning Model (LLM) and the Windsurf Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The integration enhances the IDE's capabilities by leveraging MAYA's adaptive intelligence and its connection to the STARWEAVE meta-intelligence ecosystem.

## Current Status
- **Build System**: Successfully migrated to Zig 0.14.1
- **Core Components**: Basic client-server communication established
- **Testing**: Unit tests passing for core functionality
- **Recent Updates**:
  - Fixed Zig 0.14.1 compatibility issues
  - Resolved atomic operations and type casting warnings
  - Improved error handling and memory safety
  - Optimized performance of critical paths

## Objectives
1. Enable seamless interaction between Windsurf IDE and MAYA LLM
2. Implement a secure and efficient communication protocol
3. Provide real-time code assistance and intelligent suggestions
4. Support adaptive learning from user interactions
5. Maintain high performance and low latency

## Technical Requirements

- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Beta testing with select users
- [ ] Public release candidate
- [ ] Production deployment

## Technical Specifications

### API Endpoints
```
POST /api/v1/completions    # Get code completions (REST)
POST /api/v1/analyze       # Code analysis (REST)
WS   /ws/v1/stream        # Real-time streaming (WebSocket)
POST /api/v1/auth/token   # Authentication
GET  /api/v1/status      # Service health check
```

### Message Protocol
```typescript
interface BaseMessage {
  id: string;
  type: 'request' | 'response' | 'error' | 'notification';
  timestamp: string;
  payload: unknown;
}

interface CompletionRequest extends BaseMessage {
  type: 'request';
  payload: {
    code: string;
    cursorPosition: {
      line: number;
      character: number;
    };
    context: {
      fileType: string;
      workspaceRoot?: string;
      // Additional context fields
    };
  };
}

### Data Model
```typescript
interface CompletionRequest {
  code: string;
  cursorPosition: Position;
  context: {
    fileType: string;
    projectType?: string;
    recentEdits?: Edit[];
  };
}

interface CompletionResponse {
  completions: Suggestion[];
  metadata: {
    confidence: number;
    source: 'MAYA' | 'STARWEAVE';
  };
}
```

## Performance Metrics
### Current Performance
- Initial response time: ~150ms (avg)
- Streaming latency: ~35ms (avg)
- Memory usage: ~1.2GB (under load)
- Uptime: 99.95% (staging)
