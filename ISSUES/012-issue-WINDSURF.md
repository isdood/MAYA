# WINDSURF IDE Integration with MAYA LLM

**Issue #012**  
**Status**: Planning  
**Priority**: High  
**Created**: 2025-06-17  
**Target Completion**: TBD  

## Overview
This document outlines the development plan for integrating the MAYA Language Learning Model (LLM) into the Windsurf Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The integration aims to enhance the IDE's capabilities by leveraging MAYA's adaptive intelligence and its connection to the STARWEAVE meta-intelligence ecosystem.

## Objectives
1. Enable seamless interaction between Windsurf IDE and MAYA LLM
2. Implement a secure and efficient communication protocol
3. Provide real-time code assistance and intelligent suggestions
4. Support adaptive learning from user interactions
5. Maintain high performance and low latency

## Technical Requirements

### 1. System Architecture
- **MAYA LLM Service**
  - Deploy MAYA as a standalone service
  - Implement gRPC/WebSocket interface for real-time communication
  - Support for authentication and rate limiting

- **Windsurf IDE Plugin**
  - Develop a native extension/plugin for Windsurf
  - Implement secure connection to MAYA service
  - User interface components for MAYA interactions

### 2. Core Features

#### Phase 1: Basic Integration
- [ ] Establish secure connection between Windsurf and MAYA
- [ ] Implement basic text-based interaction
- [ ] Add status indicators for MAYA connection state
- [ ] Basic command palette integration

#### Phase 2: Code Intelligence
- [ ] Real-time code completion
- [ ] Context-aware suggestions
- [ ] Documentation tooltips
- [ ] Code navigation

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Adaptive learning from user behavior
- [ ] Integration with STARWEAVE meta-intelligence
- [ ] Custom command execution
- [ ] Multi-language support

### 3. Security Considerations
- Implement OAuth2/API key authentication
- Encrypt all communications (TLS 1.3+)
- Rate limiting and usage quotas
- Data privacy controls
- Audit logging

## Development Milestones

### Milestone 1: Proof of Concept (2 weeks)
- [ ] Basic plugin skeleton
- [ ] Simple echo service implementation
- [ ] Basic UI components

### Milestone 2: Core Functionality (4 weeks)
- [ ] Full gRPC/WebSocket implementation
- [ ] Authentication system
- [ ] Basic code intelligence features

### Milestone 3: Refinement (3 weeks)
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Error handling and recovery
- [ ] User documentation

### Milestone 4: Testing & Release (3 weeks)
- [ ] Unit and integration tests
- [ ] Security audit
- [ ] Beta testing with select users
- [ ] Public release

## Technical Specifications

### API Endpoints
```
POST /api/v1/completions    # Get code completions
POST /api/v1/analyze       # Code analysis
WS   /ws/v1/stream        # Real-time streaming
```

### Data Model
```typescript
interface CompletionRequest {
  code: string;
  cursorPosition: Position;
  context: {
    fileType: string;
    projectType?: string;
    recentEdits?: Edit[];
  };
}

interface CompletionResponse {
  completions: Suggestion[];
  metadata: {
    confidence: number;
    source: 'MAYA' | 'STARWEAVE';
  };
}
```

## Performance Targets
- Initial response time: < 200ms
- Streaming latency: < 50ms
- Uptime: 99.9%
- Max memory usage: 2GB per session

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for individual components
2. Integration tests for MAYA-Windsurf communication
3. Performance benchmarking
4. Security penetration testing
5. User acceptance testing

## Dependencies
- Node.js 16+
- Python 3.8+ (for MAYA service)
- gRPC/Protobuf
- WebSocket
- React (for UI components)

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|-------------|----------------------|
| Performance issues | High | Medium | Implement caching, optimize model inference |
| Security vulnerabilities | Critical | Low | Regular security audits, follow best practices |
| Integration complexity | High | High | Modular design, thorough testing |
| User adoption | Medium | Medium | Intuitive UI, comprehensive documentation |

## Future Enhancements
1. Support for custom model fine-tuning
2. Integration with additional STARWEAVE components
3. Advanced debugging assistance
4. Team collaboration features
5. Plugin marketplace for MAYA extensions

## Success Metrics
1. Response time under 200ms for 95% of requests
2. >90% user satisfaction rate
3. <1% error rate in production
4. Adoption by >50% of active Windsurf users within 3 months
