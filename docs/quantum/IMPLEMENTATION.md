# Quantum Circuit Builder Implementation

## Architecture Overview

The Quantum Circuit Builder is implemented in Zig and consists of several key components:

1. **Qubit State Representation**
   - Uses complex numbers to represent quantum states
   - Tracks both real and imaginary components
   - Implements state normalization

2. **Quantum Gates**
   - Matrix-based gate operations
   - Support for single and multi-qubit gates
   - Efficient gate application algorithms

3. **Circuit Management**
   - Tracks multiple qubits and their states
   - Manages gate applications and measurements
   - Handles circuit history and undo/redo functionality

## Core Data Structures

### QubitState
```zig
const QubitState = struct {
    alpha: f64 = 1.0,     // |0⟩ amplitude (real)
    beta: f64 = 0.0,      // |1⟩ amplitude (real)
    beta_imag: f64 = 0.0, // |1⟩ amplitude (imaginary)
    // ... methods ...
};
```

### QuantumCircuit
```zig
const QuantumCircuit = struct {
    qubits: []QubitState,
    allocator: Allocator,
    history: std.ArrayList([]const u8),
    // ... methods ...
};
```

## Key Algorithms

### State Evolution
1. Gate application using matrix multiplication
2. State normalization after each operation
3. Measurement with probabilistic collapse

### Circuit Optimization
1. Gate fusion for consecutive operations
2. Dead code elimination
3. Constant propagation

## Performance Considerations

- **Memory Efficiency**:
  - Minimal memory overhead for state representation
  - Efficient allocation strategies

- **Computation**:
  - Optimized gate operations
  - Lazy evaluation where possible

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for complete circuits
- Property-based testing for gate operations
- Fuzz testing for file I/O operations

## Dependencies

- Standard Zig library only
- No external dependencies
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Extension Points

1. **New Gates**:
   - Implement new gate types
   - Add custom gate definitions

2. **Visualization**:
   - Custom output formats
   - Alternative rendering backends

3. **Optimizations**:
   - Circuit simplification
   - Parallel execution
   - Just-in-time compilation
