# Integrating MAYA into Your Tools

MAYA is designed to be easily integrated into various development tools and IDEs. This guide explains how to integrate MAYA into your environment.

## Basic Integration

### 1. Add MAYA as a Dependency

Add MAYA to your project's dependencies. For Zig projects, add the following to your `build.zig`:

```zig
const maya_module = b.addModule("maya", .{
    .root_source_file = .{ .path = "path/to/maya/src/learning/maya.zig" },
});
```

### 2. Initialize MAYA

```zig
const Maya = @import("maya").Maya;

// Initialize with your allocator
var maya = try Maya.init(allocator);
defer maya.deinit();
```

### 3. Record Interactions

```zig
try maya.recordInteraction(context, action);
```

### 4. Analyze Patterns

```zig
const patterns = try maya.analyzePatterns();
defer allocator.free(patterns);
```

## IDE Integration

### VS Code Extension

1. Create a new VS Code extension project
2. Add MAYA as a dependency
3. Implement the following features:
   - Command recording
   - Pattern analysis
   - Suggestions based on patterns

### Neovim Plugin

1. Create a new Neovim plugin
2. Use MAYA's API to record and analyze interactions
3. Implement commands for:
   - Starting/stopping recording
   - Viewing patterns
   - Applying suggestions

## Integration Points

### 1. Command Recording

Record user interactions at these points:
- File edits
- Command execution
- Navigation
- Search operations

### 2. Pattern Analysis

Run pattern analysis:
- On demand
- Periodically
- After significant changes

### 3. Suggestions

Use detected patterns to:
- Suggest completions
- Recommend refactorings
- Predict next actions

## Example Integration

See the `examples/basic_usage.zig` file for a complete example of using MAYA in a Zig project.

## Best Practices

1. **Memory Management**
   - Always use `defer maya.deinit()` to clean up resources
   - Use appropriate allocators for your environment

2. **Error Handling**
   - Handle all potential errors from MAYA operations
   - Provide meaningful error messages to users

3. **Performance**
   - Run pattern analysis in the background
   - Cache results when appropriate
   - Use appropriate data structures for your use case
