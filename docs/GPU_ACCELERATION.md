# GPU Acceleration for HYPERCUBE 4D Neural Architecture

This document outlines the GPU acceleration implementation for the HYPERCUBE 4D neural architecture, focusing on the spiral convolution and 4D attention mechanisms.

## Overview

The GPU acceleration pipeline consists of the following components:

1. **CUDA Kernels**: Optimized CUDA kernels for 4D transformations
2. **Zig Wrappers**: Safe Zig interfaces to the CUDA code
3. **Benchmarking Tools**: Performance measurement and profiling tools
4. **Build System**: Integration with the Zig build system

## Prerequisites

- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (Compute Capability 6.0 or higher)
- CUDA Toolkit 11.0 or later
- Zig 0.11.0 or later
- GCC or Clang with C++17 support

## Building

To build with GPU acceleration:

```bash
# Build the project with CUDA support
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast

# Run benchmarks
zig build benchmark

# Run CUDA tests
zig build test-cuda
```

## Implementation Details

### Spiral Convolution Kernel

The `spiral_convolution_4d` CUDA kernel performs 4D transformations with the following features:

- 4D coordinate transformation
- Gravity well attention
- Fibonacci spiral processing
- Optimized memory access patterns

### Memory Management

- Uses CUDA Unified Memory for simplified memory management
- Batched operations to maximize GPU utilization
- Asynchronous memory transfers to overlap computation and data movement

### Performance Optimizations

- Tiled memory access patterns for better cache utilization
- Shared memory for frequently accessed data
- Optimized thread block and grid dimensions
- Pinned host memory for faster transfers

## Benchmarking

The benchmark tool measures the performance of different transformation operations:

```bash
# Run all benchmarks
zig build benchmark

# Run specific benchmark
./zig-out/bin/pattern_transform_benchmark --filter "gravity_well"
```

Benchmark results are saved to `pattern_transform_benchmark.json` for analysis.

## Profiling

To profile the CUDA kernels:

```bash
# Profile with Nsight Systems
nsys profile -o profile_output ./zig-out/bin/pattern_transform_benchmark

# Analyze with Nsight Compute
ncu -o profile_compute ./zig-out/bin/pattern_transform_benchmark
```

## Future Optimizations

- [ ] Implement 4D tiling for better cache locality
- [ ] Add support for mixed-precision calculations
- [ ] Implement kernel fusion for combined operations
- [ ] Add support for multi-GPU processing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **CUDA Not Found**: Ensure CUDA is installed and in your `PATH`
   ```bash
   export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   ```

2. **Insufficient GPU Memory**: Reduce the batch size or pattern dimensions

3. **Kernel Launch Failures**: Check CUDA error codes and kernel parameters
